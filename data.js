The cleanroom itself comprises two sections â€“ designated the white area and the yellow area. It is fully fitted with dedicated fume cupboards and workstations. It is class 1000 in the main regions, and class 100 in the lithography suite (the class denotes how clean the air is - the lower the number the less contaminating particles in the air). The white area is generally used for measurements and depositions, whilst the yellow area is used for wet processes.  The main areas of research include microscale device fabrication, organic/plastic electronics (OLEDs, OPV, organic transistors), paper based devices, THz structures surface coatings and specialist materials and nanoscale devices and structures."

They are also used to generate electricity. All electric machines are basically electromechanical energy conversion systems which work based on the principles of interactions of electric and magnetic fields (electromagnetism) first discovered and formulated by Faraday, Ampere and Maxwell in the latter half of the 19th century. In this experiment students will learn how principles such as the law of electromagnetic induction is applied to generate electricity in a rotating electric machine simply by applying a rotational mechanical force to the machine and allowing it to interact with a magnetic field. This basic principle is the very same process with which we generate electricity in our power plants."

DC motors are more versatile and flexible to control and operate. In this experiment students will learn how they can control the motor speed and its torque by varying motor supply. Students will learn how they can relate speed variations to electric power applied to the motor and how changes in one will impact the other. This relationship between speed and applied electric power in a DC motor provides a powerful tool for us to create variable speed and variable torque motor drive systems for example for electric cars that can outperform even the most powerful and efficient internal combustion engines."
